### About 

This notebook is meant to be a short introduction to Blockchain implementations, aimed at helping us take the topics we learn about in fundamentals, and seeing how they translate to code. 

In this notebook we will implement various different aspects of Blockchain technology that we understand including: 

- The Blockchain Data Structure using OOP 
- A proof of work simulation 
- Understanding of the concept of difficulty of finding the next block hash 
- A simulation of multiple miners with varying computational powers 
- A bit of data analytics to see if what we've implemented makes sense 



### Getting Started

Make sure you have `Python 3` and `Jupyter Notebook` installed.

If you are missing packages, please use `pip` to install them.

You might need to install package `ipyparallel` . You can do so by ` pip install ipyparallel`. 

You should be able to open the Jupyter notebook from terminal by typing `jupyter notebook` in the `hw1` directory.



### Instruction and Check Off

Carefully read through the descriptions in each section. Fill out the skeleton code, demonstrate that you can pass the tests, and answers the short questions.

Once you are done, please show any instructor so we can get you checked off.
