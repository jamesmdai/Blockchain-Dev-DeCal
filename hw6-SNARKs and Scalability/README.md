## HW6 **SNARKs and Scalability**

Written by Dev Ojha (Blockchain at Berkeley) and Simon Zirui Guo.



In lecture, we covered a high-level overview of SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and various aspects of Blockchain scalability.

For this week, given the current world event and campus situation, we will switch to a non-development exercise. 

To learn about the latest developments in Blockchain protocols, it is oftentimes important to listen to talks, read whitepapers, and blogposts. Here are some relevant materials that our guest lecturer Dev has recommended:

* [CESC2017: Zerocash - Alessandro Chiesa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Vbj7-i9CI) ([Alessandro Chiesa](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/) is an Assistant Professor at Berkeley EECS!  Prof. Chiesa also teaches [CS 170](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS170/) this semester.)
* [CESC18: Transparent zkSNARKs - Alessandro Chiesa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S69rT1JoCsU)
* [Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649) by Vitalik Buterin
* [Purportedly simplest SNARK](https://github.com/initc3/babySNARK/blob/master/babysnark.pdf)

For this week's checkoff, watch or read **one** of the above talks or paper, and write a response regarding it **no less than 200 words and no more than 300 words**. 

Your response should have a short summary and your main takeaway. 

You can submit your response [here](https://forms.gle/SCMkVjuwXVhvhn1i7) to be checked off.
