### Part II: ERC20 Token Demo

An Ethereum smart contract issuing ERC20 token.

Credit from the legendary Ethereum unicorn rider, [BokkyPooBah](https://medium.com/u/f5b908f9db99).

Things you need to change before deployment:

* *Line 103 and 104*: the Ropsten Ethereum address you created in MyEtherWallet
* Line 99: Symbol to your respective coin name 
* Line 85, 100 to the name of your token



### Check Off

To receive credit for this homework, you must complete both parts. 

For part I, as long as you fill out the quiz, you will be marked as finished. A score will be emailed to you as well.

For part II, after you finish, you should be able to use MetaMask to add your ERC20 tokens. Please show us in person or send us a screenshot of that and with identifiable information (terminal user name, the user name on the top-right for OS X, etc), so that we know it is your work.
